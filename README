CrewAI Hierarchical Tutorial
Overview
This repository hosts the updated CrewAI tutorial, showcasing advanced AI-powered automation through hierarchical, asynchronous tasks with callbacks and predefined expected outputs. It is designed to illustrate an enhanced workflow for building AI-driven newsletter automation tools.

Features
Hierarchical Task Management: Leverage the power of structured task execution to maintain a clean and scalable codebase.
Asynchronous Tasks: Improve performance with non-blocking operations, allowing tasks to run concurrently.
Callbacks: Ensure that each task can trigger subsequent actions upon completion, enabling a reactive task flow.
Expected Outputs: Define the anticipated results for each task, streamlining debugging and ensuring quality control.

Structure
main.py: The entry point script that initializes the agents and tasks, and forms the AI crew.
agents.py: Defines various agents like the editor, news fetcher, news analyzer, and newsletter compiler.
tasks.py: Contains the task definitions that are used by the agents to perform specific operations.
file_io.py: Manages file input/output operations, crucial for handling the async flow of data.
Crew Formation
The crew is composed of multiple agents and tasks orchestrated to perform complex newsletter automation.

python
Copy code
crew = Crew(
    agents=[editor, news_fetcher, news_analyzer, newsletter_compiler],
    tasks=[fetch_news_task, analyze_news_task, compile_newsletter_task],
    process=Process.hierarchical,
    manager=lm=OpenAIGPT4,
    verbose=2
)
